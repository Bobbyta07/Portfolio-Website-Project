        <h4>Education background</h4>
        <br/>
        <p class="lead">I hold an ND in Computer Science from the College of Agriculture, Ishiagu, Ebonyi State, where
          I laid the foundation for my journey in the tech world. I further pursued a B.Engr in Computer Engineering
          from Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, where I gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on
          experience in various aspects of computer engineering. To enhance my skills further, I completed the
          comprehensive "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" with Angela Yu on Udemy, which
          solidified my proficiency in Python.</p>
